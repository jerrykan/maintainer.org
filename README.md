# maintainer.org

The goal of maintainer.org is to create a place where project maintainers can ask for help 
maintaining an open source project or find somebody to take over projects they no longer 
wish to run.

Preliminary sketches:

- As static as possible. Site is regenerated server side, CSS inline, etc.
  - tools/rebuild-site.sh  

- Help with or handoff requests filed via pull request.
  - Structure?
  - Project name
  - Maintainer name
  - email
  - help wanted? - new owner, co-maintainer, etc.
  - Skillset - JS, Python, Illustrator, other.
  - Other text?

- Preliminary process:
  - Mailing list
  - Link to RSS feed
  - link RSS feed to Twitter via IFTTT?

- Next steps.
  - Forums?
  - Marketing it?
  - (G-Ads?)
