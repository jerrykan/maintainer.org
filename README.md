# maintainer.org

The goal of maintainer.org is to create a place where project maintainers can ask for help 
maintaining an open source project or find somebody to take over projects they no longer 
wish to run.

Preliminary sketches:

- As static as possible. Site is regenerated server side, CSS inline, etc. 

- Help with or handoff requests filed via pull request.
  - Structure?
  - Project name
  - Maintainer name
  - email
  - help wanted? - new owner, co-maintainer, etc.
  - Skillset - JS, Python, Illustrator, other.
  - Other text?

- Regenerate site, add to RSS feed.

To do:

- Write and style index.html
- Learn some mobile CSS tricks. (check, kinda?) 

- Write some code that stands up both some HTML and an RSS feed.
- Write some server-side croncat stuff to tie it all together.
