<p>This code of conduct applies to all Maintainer.org events, spaces or forums.</p>

<p>Anyone who violates this code of conduct will be barred from these spaces
or forums at the sole discretion of site administrators. Participants are responsible
for understanding and abiding by these rules.</p>

<h2>In Detail</h2>

<p>Maintainer.org is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.  This code
of conduct applies to all Maintainer.org spaces, including public and private
forums, mailing lists or events.

<p>Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled
from these spaces at the discretion of the site or event administrators.</p>

<p>Some Maintainer.org spaces may have additional rules in place, which will
be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible
for knowing and abiding by these rules.</p>

<p>Harassment includes: <ul>  	

<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical
appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li> 
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and
practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs,
and employment.</li> 
<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.</li>
<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where
they're not appropriate.</li> 
<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions
like "*hug*" or "*backrub*") without consent or after a request to
stop.</li> 
<li>Threats of violence.</li> 
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a
person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li> 
<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li> 
<li>Stalking or following.</li> 
<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity
for harassment purposes.</li> 
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li> 
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li> 
<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li> 
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
<li>Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without
their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional
abuse.</li> 
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>Further: Maintainer.org prioritizes marginalized people's safety and
well-being over privileged people's comfort. Maintainer.org administrators 
<i>will not</i> act on complaints regarding:

<ul>  	
<li>'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,'
and 'cisphobia'</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone,"
"go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."</li>
<li>Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial</li>
<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior
or assumptions</li> </ul></p>

<p>If you are being harassed by a participant on any of Maintainer.org's
spaces or forums, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
other concerns, please <a href="mailto:mhoye@bespokeio.com">contact Mike Hoye</a>
 - currently sole maintainer - directly.</p>

<p>The administrators of Maintainer.org will take all good-faith reports of 
harassment seriously, and reserve the right to exclude people from Maintainer.org
forums or events based on past behavior, including behavior outside Maintainer.org
spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Maintainer.org.  In order to
protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we
believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate
criticism may be deleted without response.  We will respect confidentiality
requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We may publicly name
a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately
warn third parties about them if we believe that doing so will increase
the safety of Maintainer.org participants or the general public. We will not
name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<p>No harassment, no assholes, no nazis.</p>

<p>Thank you,<p>
