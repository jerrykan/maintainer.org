# maintainer.org

The goal of maintainer.org is to create a place where project maintainers can ask for help 
maintaining an open source project or find somebody to take over projects they no longer 
wish to run.

Preliminary to-do:

- MVP: mailing list, twitter, what else?
- Site as locally-static as possible.
- CoC done - next steps?
  - Forums?
  - (G-Ads?)

- Provide framework for mailing list submission:
  - Name
  - URL
  - Requirements 
    - skills?
    - time investment?
    - Languages (code, spoken?)
  - Contact info
    - Forums?

Aspirational goals:
- Site less ugly?
